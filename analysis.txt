  Please put the  generate_tbl_part1.c with the trace file under the same directory.
  And then run the following command to Compile and run.

  - Compile:
    gcc generate_tbl_part1.c  -o generate_tbl_part1

  - To run the program:
    ./generate_tbl_part1 <traceFile>

  Note: <traceFile> is the file name of the trace file, eg.addr-blocked.ref

Pages that are accessed the most:
Instruction:  0x00108000, data: 0x0030a000

Explanation:
For instruction pages, we think 0x00108000 is where the instructions such as arithmetic operations are stored.
For data pages, we think 0x0030a000 is where the most used variables such as matrix A, B, C are stored.

Pages that are accessed the most:
Instruction:  0x00108000, data: multiple pages from 0x0402a000 to 0x04062000

Explanation:
For instruction pages, we think 0x00108000 is where the instructions such as arithmetic operations are stored.
For data pages, we think multiple pages from 0x0402a000 to 0x04062000 are where the variables in data[] are stored. 
And the way these pages are accessed for the same number of times is because of the for loop.

Pages that are accessed the most:
Instruction:  0x00108000, data: 0x1fff000000

Explanation:
For instruction pages, we think 0x00108000 is where the instructions such as arithmetic operations are stored.
For data pages, we think 0x1fff000000 is where the most used variable, ptr, is stored.
